WELCOME TO LISTS_IO_RANDOM EXERCISE 1

BEFORE YOU DO ANY CODING COPY THE BELOW TEXT INTO THE .replit FILE

language = "python3"
run = "cd 'Lesson 3 - Lists, IO, Random'; cd exercises; clear; python3 exercise1.py"

For examples please refer to the example files

Start with the base code below 

GOAL: Ask the user if they want an even or odd. If even, user enters “E”, if odd, user enters “O”. If even is chosen, randomly generate a number from the array [0,2,4]. If odd is chosen, randomly generate a number from the array [1,3,5]. 

Hint: need conditionals to determine which dice AND use input to collect user input
