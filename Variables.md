# Variables
Definition: Something that stores other things
## What is a variable? 
Here are three example sentences: 

* I like ice cream and french fries
* You like ice cream and french fries
* My neighbor likes ice cream and french fries

To change “ice cream and french fries” you have to change it in three different places (too much work)!

X = ice cream and french fries

I like X
You like X
My neighbor likes X

## In Python
Variable Names:
* Separate words by _
* Make them descriptive
* Cannot start with number or symbol (!, @, etc.)

### In Python: Variable Types:

** Ex: "Hello, my name is Maddy"
* Chars: single letter, number, or symbol in single quotes
** Ex: 'a', ';', ' ', '!', etc.
* Integer: Whole numbers
** Ex: 1, 5, 463836, 472, 36283
* Floats: decimal numbers
** Ex: 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 3.1483
* Boolean: True or False expression
** Ex: True, False, (7 > 0)

#### In Python: Strings
Strings need quotes around words:
variable_name = "value"
Ex:
```python
favorite_food = "ice cream and french fries"
```
#### In Python: Numbers:
variable_name = value
Ex:
```python
five_as_an_integer = 5
five_as_a_float = 5.0
```
#### In Python: Boolean
variable_name = value
```python
likes_ice_cream = True
```
